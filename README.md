# IoT-Project
Waste management system using a Raspberry Pi
______________________________________________
My project aims to create a waste-management system using python and physical hardware components. My project will measure trash levels collected in garbage cans, have a graphical user interface using Tkinter, and have a basic security system made from a simple button combination.


# Physical Components
- Breadboard + Jumper Wires
- Raspberry Pi (Model B)
- GPIO Extension Board + Wires
- Ultrasonic Sensor
- LEDS
- Passive / Active Buzzer
- Red and Blue Buttons
